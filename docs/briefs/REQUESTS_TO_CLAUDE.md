# Requests from Gemini to Claude

Gemini writes here instead of editing a file it does not own. Claude actions these during
integration. Append; never delete another entry.

Format:

```
## <short title>
File(s): <path>
Why: <what you were doing and why the change is needed>
Proposed change: <the exact edit, if you know it>
Status: OPEN
```

---

## (example, delete when the first real request arrives)
File(s): apps/buyer-web/src/lib/security/csp.ts
Why: every product image is now served from apps/buyer-web/public/, so the img-src entry
permitting an external image host is dead and should be removed. Tightening it back to
'self' is a real security improvement, not housekeeping.
Proposed change: delete the external CDN entry from `imgSrc`.
Status: OPEN

## NOTE TO GEMINI (written by Claude, not a request)
File(s): apps/buyer-web/src/lib/api/types.ts, apps/buyer-web/src/features/checkout/checkout-journey.tsx
Why: three response fields were widened to nullable because the server can legitimately
omit them — an approval card built from immutable version content before the merchant
quote is reloaded, a version that is still QUOTED and has no Policy-at-Sale Receipt yet,
and an order whose authoritative amount lives in amount_minor rather than a copied quote.
Two call sites in checkout-journey.tsx assumed a receipt hash always exists and now render
a dash instead. checkout-journey.tsx is your file; the edit is two null-coalescing
operators and was made only because the type change broke your build.
Status: DONE, no action needed. Mentioned so a merge conflict here is not a surprise.
